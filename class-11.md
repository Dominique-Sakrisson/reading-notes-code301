  Concerning the graphs for the Diversity in tech its pretty clear to see that white males are prodominate in the industry. When cycling through the years from 2014-2017 there is also a clear shift away from that trend accross the industry. I'm most curious to see what the numbers look like for the 4 years following as well and if the trend of more diversity continues. I would wager it's headed in a good direction. 
  
Interesting read on the tech marketing in the 80's. All I can say is its a bummer that's how things went and the best thing to do is prmomote for more diversity in the future. 

I've always thought of diversity and general acceptance of one another to be a moral thing and thats about it. I have'nt thought of it in terms of making a better product before though. The USA article has some good imagery from a user/product standpoint with videos being uploaded upside down becaue the filmer was left handed. We can think similarly in terms of local politics. It wouldnt make sense having some other town in another state voting and making laws for a town in Oregon in which they've never lived. Diversity in tech/ product development can be viewed similarly I think. To best form the experience to a diverse crowd, the people building it must of that diverse crowd.
