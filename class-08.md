## SQL

Reading through the book currently we'll see how far I get before this is due but so far what I like about SQL is that the commands are all so close to normal english I don't expect it to be very difficult to work with. 
The cheat sheat is a really nice tool, I'm already coping down most of it onto notecards for my wall.
Basically SQL is a language used to talk to the server when making requests from the client side. We can structure those requests in very detailed ways in order to get the data we want and only the data we want.
