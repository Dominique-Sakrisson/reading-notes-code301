# HTML FORM STYLES VIDEOs

Definitely enjoyed this video, I ended up looking at some more videos on that youtube channel it seems like they have some really good content. I liked the input validation part that styled the forms with the :valid pseudo class and styling the checkboxes when they are checked with a separate image that isnt the normal fill dot.
